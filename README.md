# Ruby Without Framework

Rails is powerful, but much of what it does is more convenience than necessity. This repo demonstrates a naive pseudo-microframework layout. The intent is NOT for production code, just a demonstration of what you can do with only [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack), the standard interface by which most Ruby web frameworks align

### To Run Example
* Run `bin/bundle binstubs`
* Run `bin/rackup rack_demo.ru`
* Visit `localhost:9292`
